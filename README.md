# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## What is a Kickstarter?
Kickstarter campaigns are a way to bring creative ideas to life. The goal of a Kickstarter campaign is to share creative ideas with a large audience who will help fund the projects. The following report will showcase the results of several Kickstarter campaigns. Many of these campaigns failed for various reasons. The data provided will give insight into the leading causes of success or failure of a campaign. A careful analysis of the data will help to streamline future campaing efforts.
### Success or Fail
Each campaign had a set goal that was needed to bring the creative work to life. For example the Good Bread Alley play had a goal of $100,000. The campaign was deemed a success because $100,036.00 was pledged by crowdfunders. The data will reflect similar campaigns that exceeded their funding goals. Unlike Good Bread Alley other campaigns such as My Prive Revolution did not reach its funding goal. My Private Revolution had a goal of $50,000 but only $10,775 was pledged. The below image reflects the number of successful US campaigns as well as the failed campaigns.

## Recommendations
Kickstarter campaigns are an excellent way to fund creative works. For the creator this is a way to introduce an idea without having to fund the project themselves. Based on the results of the current analysis there is a strategy that should be employed going forward. As we can see many of the campaigns that were attempted were deemed a failure. This is to say that the campaign did not raise the intended funds needed to produce the project. According to the results of the campaigns the recommendation would be to keep  the goals of the campaigns lower. The successful campaigns did not have large mean goals and their mean pledge amount was more aligned with the goal amount. Going forward these historical results should be used to construct future Kickstarter campaigns.
